***rule_based_classification_project***

A gaming company wants to create new level-based customer definitions (personas) by using certain characteristics of its customers and, based on these new customer definitions, establish segments to estimate how much potential new customers might contribute to the company's revenue on average. 

For example:
They want to determine the average revenue generated by a 25-year-old male user from Turkey who uses iOS.


The Persona.csv dataset contains the prices of products sold by an international gaming company, along with some demographic information about the users who purchased these products. The dataset is composed of records generated from each sales transaction. This means that the table is not deduplicated. In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made multiple purchases.


Variables;
PRICE – The amount spent by the customer
SOURCE – The type of device the customer connected from
SEX – The customer's gender
COUNTRY – The customer's country
AGE – The customer's age
